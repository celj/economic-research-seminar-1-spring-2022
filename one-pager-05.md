### Research Question / Tested Hypothesis / Main Argument

It wonders if we can establish a causal relationship between culture and institutions which, in turn, may be determined by endogenous variables such as geography, technology, historical events, etc. What roles do culture and institutions play in determining the wealth of nations?

#### Model / Assumptions

A regression is run to analyse the correlation between cultural traits such as: family ties, general morality, individualism, trust and job luck.

#### Methodology

Both concepts are defined. Then they measure cultural impact in three ways: with survey data, second generation immigration analysis and their resistance to cultural impact, and experimental evidence.

#### Data

Interviews with people in:

- Mexico
- USA
- UK
- Germany
- Italy

The author fetches empirical evidence in work from Henrich, Gneezy, Leibbrandt, List, Herrmann, Thoni, Gachter, etc.

#### Data Inventory

Different institutions and their performance in different current cultures could be analysed in order to determine the causality of a culture being in a certain way and thus analyse their joint impact in determining the wealth of different countries, whether they have similar institutions or not.
