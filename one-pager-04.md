### Research Question / Tested Hypothesis / Main Argument

Why do societies fail to adopt the institutional structure of more economically successful ones?

#### Model / Assumptions

This work uses concepts from game theory and sociology to build a comparative analysis between cultural relationships and institutional structure. It focuses on muslim and latin societies during the middle ages. Both societies find themselves subject to the same technologies and environment, facing the same organisational issues, but distinct cultures, which is a sufficient condition for it to explain these societies following distinct trajectories in terms of their organisational structure.

#### Methodology

It focuses on Game Theory concepts such as *cooperation* analyzing transaction costs, restrictions, social roles, and duties.
