### Research Question / Tested Hypothesis / Main Argument

Why do societies fail to adopt the institutional structure of more economically successful ones?

#### Model / Assumptions

This work uses concepts from game theory and sociology to build a comparative analysis between cultural relationships and institutional structure. It focuses on muslim and latin societies during the middle ages. Both societies find themselves subject to the same technologies and environment, facing the same organisational issues, but distinct cultures, which is a sufficient condition for it to explain these societies following distinct trajectories in terms of their organisational structure.

#### Methodology

They study the relationships between culture and society’s organization through a game with multiple equilibria. First of all, they match cultural beliefs to their institutional organisation. As a complete information game, they search how each group mitigates the agent-trader engagement problem. There $M$ traders and $A$ agents in this economy, assuming $M < A$. There is also a factor discount $\beta$, and an unemployed agent receives a reserve amount. Every period, a trader can hire only one agent, so she decides whether to be honest or cheat — which determines the payoff for both sets of players. This way, the model analyses efficiency in cooperation through rewards for the agent to keep or finish her relation with the employer.

Later on, they describe origins, cultural belief manifestations, social patterns, and wealth distribution for both groups. Finally, integrated and segregated societies and their effects on the institutional structure are analysed for further organisational evolution.

#### Data

They use data from Genoese society during the middle ages (post Roman Empire). On the other hand, they analyse the society of Jewish merchants known as the “Maghribi” who were located in the Mediterranean. Both societies had naval technology and traded similar goods.

#### Data Inventory

Different cultures with similar trade behaviours may replicate this method for multiple eras.
